## FortiManager API Proxy (CORS/SSL Solution)

### Why?

Browsers enforce strict CORS and SSL rules, which can block direct API calls to FortiManager. To solve this, use the provided backend proxy server.

### How to Use

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install express node-fetch cors
   ```
2. **Run the proxy server:**

   ```bash
   node src/api/proxy-server.js
   ```

   The proxy will run on `http://localhost:4000` by default.

3. **Configure the frontend:**
   - Update your API calls to POST to `http://localhost:4000/api/fortimanager` with a JSON body:
     ```json
     {
       "apiUrl": "https://manager.flowerbed.nl",
       "apiToken": "<your-api-token>",
       "body": { ...jsonrpc request... }
     }
     ```
   - The proxy will forward the request to FortiManager and return the response.

### Security Note

- This proxy disables SSL verification for development. For production, use a valid certificate and remove the `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` line.

### Why is this needed?

- FortiManager does not send CORS headers, so browsers block direct requests.
- This proxy allows your app to communicate securely and reliably with FortiManager.
